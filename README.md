# EyeColor
The work by Sturm et al. titled “A Single SNP in an Evolutionary Conserved Region within Intron 86 of the HERC2 Gene Determines Human BlueRBrown Eye Color”  (accessible on the LMS or online at  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707000407)  describes that eye colour in humans can be determined with reasonable confidence  by single SNPs: two highly predictive variants named rs12913832 and rs1129038  are explored in the paper. In this study we are going to analyse DNA  sequencing data upon the status of these SNPs in multiple samples to estimate the  eye colour of the sequenced individuals.   The SNPs are located in the HERC2 gene on the human chromosome 15.  The exact locations in the human reference are chr15:28365618 for rs12913832  and chr15:28356859 for rs1129038.
